            This is a normal paragraph.
            <blockquote>
                This is suppous to be a <mark>Blockquote.</mark> Idk if it is working or not.
               <br>Btw, I checked and it works.
               So now, what is the use of cite?
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">
                For 50 years, WWF has been protecting the future of nature.
                The world's leading conservation organization,
                WWF works in 100 countries and is supported by
                1.2 million members in the United States and
                close to 5 million globally.

            The two are basically the same. So, using cite is optional and useless, (at least right now.)

            <q>In this paragraph I used a <q>quotation</q> inside of another quotation. <br> 
            B.S: Huh.... You can't use a double quotation inside of another double quotation. 
            It automatically becomes a single quotation.
